Welcome Cummins and MMCOE  College students! This repository is designed to facilitate the assignment of GitHub issues to eligible students from Cummins College and MMCOE. To ensure a smooth and efficient process, we have implemented a validation system that requires students to provide specific information when requesting assignment of an issue.

## How to Request Assignment:

3. **Validation Process**: Our team will review your pull request to ensure that you are a valid student from Cummins College or MMCOE. We will cross-check the provided information with our records to confirm your eligibility. 🕵️‍♂️

4. **Assignment Confirmation**: Once your information is validated, we will assign the requested issue to you. You will receive a notification confirming the assignment. 🎉

## Important Notes:
