# Crop Yield Optimization Web Application - Backend

## Overview

Welcome to the Crop Yield Optimization Web Application Backend! This project focuses on developing the backend infrastructure for an application that empowers farmers to optimize their crop yields. By analyzing diverse data sources, including weather data, soil data, and historical crop yield data, the backend facilitates pattern recognition and predictions for future crop yields.

## Features

1. **Data Integration**: Collect and integrate data from various sources, such as weather APIs, soil databases, and historical crop yield records.

2. **Data Analysis**: Implement robust algorithms to analyze the integrated data, identifying patterns and correlations crucial for optimizing crop yields.

3. **Predictive Modeling**: Utilize machine learning or statistical models to make predictions about future crop yields based on historical data and current environmental conditions.

4. **Scalable Architecture**: Design a scalable backend architecture to handle large volumes of data, ensuring efficiency and performance.

5. **API Documentation**: Clearly document API endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication mechanisms for seamless integration with the frontend.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the Crop Yield Optimization Web Application Backend:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/crop-yield-optimization-backend.git
    cd crop-yield-optimization-backend
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Configure Settings:**
    - Open the `config.js` file and update configuration parameters, including API keys for external data sources.

4. **Run the Application:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

5. **Access the API:**
    - The API will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` by default. Refer to the API documentation for available endpoints.
