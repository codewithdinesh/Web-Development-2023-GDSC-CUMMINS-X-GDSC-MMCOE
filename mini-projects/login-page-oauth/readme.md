# Login Page Web App with Google and GitHub OAuth 2.0 Integration

This web application project aims to create a simple and secure login page by integrating Google and GitHub authentication options using the OAuth 2.0 authentication system. This project is designed for developers looking to add social login functionality to their web applications.

## Features

- **Google and GitHub Login:** Allow users to sign in using their Google and GitHub accounts.

- **Secure Authentication:** Implement OAuth 2.0 for secure and reliable user authentication.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The app provides an intuitive user interface with buttons for Google and GitHub login options.

- **User Data Access:** Upon successful login, you can access user data provided by Google and GitHub.

- **Error Handling:** Implement error handling to handle authentication failures and provide clear error messages to users.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js and npm:** Download and install the latest versions of Node.js and npm from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

- **Google and GitHub Developer Accounts:** You'll need developer accounts with Google and GitHub to create OAuth 2.0 applications and obtain API keys and secrets.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/login-page-oauth.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd login-page-oauth
   ```

3. Install the required Node.js packages:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

### Configuration

1. Create OAuth 2.0 applications for Google and GitHub:

   - Google: Visit the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/) and create a new project. Configure OAuth 2.0 credentials and obtain a Client ID and Client Secret.
   - GitHub: Visit [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/developers) and create a new OAuth App. Obtain a Client ID and Client Secret.

2. Create a `.env` file in the project directory and add the following:

   ```
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
   GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID
   GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET
   ```

   Replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` with the values from your Google OAuth application, and do the same for GitHub.

### Running the App

1. Start the application:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

2. The app should now be running on your local machine. You can access it by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser. You'll see the login page with Google and GitHub buttons.
