# Web App Backup and Recovery System

## Overview

Welcome to the Web App Backup and Recovery System! This backend project aims to provide a simple yet robust solution for creating backups of your data and facilitating recovery in case of unexpected loss. Whether you're a developer working on a critical project or a user concerned about data integrity, this system has got you covered.

## Features

1. **Automated Backup**: Schedule regular automated backups to ensure that your data is consistently protected without manual intervention.

2. **On-Demand Backup**: Trigger a backup whenever you want to safeguard your data before making significant changes.

3. **Incremental Backups**: Save storage space and time by performing incremental backups, only capturing changes made since the last backup.

4. **Secure Storage**: Backups are securely stored in a designated location, ensuring data confidentiality and integrity.

5. **Point-in-Time Recovery**: Recover your data to a specific point in time, allowing you to roll back to a previous state.

6. **Logging and Monitoring**: Keep track of backup activities through detailed logs and set up monitoring for any potential issues.
