# Maze Generator Web App

Welcome to the Maze Generator Web App project! This web application is designed to create aesthetically pleasing and unique maze layouts with defined start and end points, allowing users to find a path from start to finish. The generated mazes are carefully designed to ensure solvability while exhibiting a sense of complexity.

## Features

- **Unique Maze Generation:** Create mazes with distinctive layouts that challenge users to find a path from start to finish.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The app offers an intuitive user interface for generating and solving mazes. It provides controls for configuring maze parameters, such as size, complexity, and more.

- **Maze Solvability:** The generated mazes are guaranteed to be solvable, ensuring that users can find a path from the start to the end point.

- **Customization:** Users can customize various aspects of maze generation, including the size, complexity, and visual style of the maze.

- **Complexity Levels:** Offer multiple complexity levels to cater to users with different preferences for maze difficulty.
