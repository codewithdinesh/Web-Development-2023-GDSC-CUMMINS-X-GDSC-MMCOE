# Blockchain-Based Voting System Backend

## Overview

Welcome to the Blockchain-Based Voting System Backend! This project is dedicated to developing a secure and transparent blockchain-based voting system. The system aims to ensure the integrity and privacy of votes in elections or polls by leveraging blockchain technology.

## Features

1. **Blockchain Integration**: Implement a robust blockchain architecture to secure and transparently record votes.

2. **Decentralized Ledger**: Utilize a decentralized ledger for maintaining an immutable record of all voting transactions.

3. **Privacy Measures**: Implement cryptographic techniques to ensure the privacy of voters while maintaining the transparency of the overall process.

4. **Secure Authentication**: Develop secure authentication mechanisms to verify the identity of voters.

5. **Vote Counting Algorithm**: Design an efficient and accurate algorithm for counting votes from the blockchain ledger.

6. **API Documentation**: Clearly document API endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication mechanisms.
